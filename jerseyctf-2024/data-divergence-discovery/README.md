## Description
I received these 2 files in an email and they mysterious sender asked me to find the differences between the files.
I cannot seem to figure out the differences, it looks all the same to me! Can you help me spot the differences.
Once you find the differences, make to sure to encapsulate it in jctf{}!

## Solution Steps
* Obviously, first download the files
* The software I used to help with the problem was called [WinMerge](https://winmerge.org/?lang=en)
* Once you download WinMerge and it is open, click `File` and then `Open`
* Choose the two files corresponding to this challenge
* Then click `Okay` at the bottom of the screen. It should know be comparing the two files
* To jump between the differences click the `Next Change` at the top, near the tool bar, to jump between the differences
* Flag: `jctf{qu4ntum_c1ph3r5}`
