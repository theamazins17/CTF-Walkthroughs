# just-go-live - easy

## Description
* Can you seem to find our flag on our service where we stream? Be careful, things aren't as they seem!

## Solution Steps
* Users will somehow navigate to our Twitch page.
*  Once there(must have a Twitch account to work), users must chat in our chat area.
*  Once they type or type pre-formed commands, a timer until the next 10 min interval starts.
*  At the 10-minute interval, the flag will print out as an automated command.
*  Flag: NICC{patience-my-purple-friend}
*  **CORRECTION** (al) : The bot prints out this instead: 	
NICC{patience_my_purple_friend}

**NOTE: The bot that shows the flag and commands is currently acting up and I am working on fixing it. Will update this README once I do.**
