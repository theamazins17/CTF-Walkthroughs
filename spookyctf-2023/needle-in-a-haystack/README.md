# needle-in-a-haystack - easy

## Description
* I lost my flag and I can't seem to find it. I know I put it in this folder, but it is not showing up. Can you help me find it?

## Solution Steps
* Open up the folder named ```haystack```.
* In the Folder Explorer, click the View option at the top of the window.
* Once you do find the check-box(or your OS equivalent) that says ```Show Hidden Files```.
* A file with the name of ```flag.txt``` should appear and open it revealing the flag.
* Flag: `NICC{th4t_w45_345y}`
